    <!-- Section 2: Biography -->
    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p>
        My name is Sumayyah, and I am currently a final-year student studying Civil Engineering in the University of Ibadan.
        Although my academic background is in the Core Engineering, my curiosity and determination have led me to explore the
        world of technology, particularly Cloud Engineering.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm a complete newbie in tech, but I have a strong passion for infrastructure, automation, and scalable systems.
        Recently, I've developed a growing interest in the technologies that power modern applications behind the scenes, from 
        servers and containers to CI/CD pipelines and cloud platforms. This curiosity has led me to start learning the basics of 
        DevOps, including version control, Linux commands, and automation workflows. Every new concept excites me, even if it sometimes feels overwhelming. I believe that starting small and
        staying consistent is the key to meaningful and lasting progress.
    </p>
    <p>
        As I dive deeper, I'm beginning to see how the different pieces fit together, from how code moves through a
        pipeline to how systems are monitored and maintained in production. I'm especially fascinated by the invisible layers of
        reliability, performance, and scalability that make great products possible.
    </p>
    <p>
        Right now, my focus is on building a strong foundation: understanding the core tools, learning by hands-on and exploring
        how teams collaborate to keep systems running smoothly. I am not in a rush, I am here to learn, grow, and eventually contribute
         to building systems that are both resilient and elegant.
    </p>


    <!-- Section 3: Why I Joined AltSchool -->
    <h2>Why I joined AltSchool</h2>
    <p>
        I joined AltSchool Africa's School of Engineering because I was looking for a structured, beginner-friendly pathway
         into tech,one that combines theory with hands-on learning and real world experience. As someone without a traditional 
         computer science background, finding a program that was immersive, practical, and mentor-led was very important to me.
    </p>
    <p>
        AltSchool stood out for its project-based curriculum, access to experienced mentors, and its emphasis on collaboration,
        feedback, and real-life problem-solving. The focus on Cloud Engineering aligns perfectly with my passion for infrastructure,
        automation, and scalable systems. I wanted more than just tutorials, I wanted guidance, community, and exposure to the tools
        and practices used by real engineers.
    </p>
    I believe AltSchool is the right platform to help me build a strong technical foundation, gain confidence through practical 
    experience, and accelerate my journey toward becoming a skilled and impactful software engineer.
    </p>

    <!-- Section 5: Hobbies and Interests -->
    <h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
    <p>Faith is the core of who I am. Reading and reflecting on the Qur'an brings me a deep sense of peace, clarity, and strength,
        especially during challenging times. It grounds me spiritually and reminds me of the importance of discipline, continuous
        learning, and personal growth.
    </p>
    <p>Outside of tech, I enjoy reading non-fiction books, exploring nature, and volunteering. I'm passionate about creating a
        life that is successful not just financially, but also spiritually and purposefully.
    </p>
    <p>I'm also a strong advocate for women in tech, and as I grow in my career, I hope to mentor and inspire others, especially
        young women navigating similar journeys.
    </p>
    <p>Ultimately, I want to be rich,not just in wealth, but in influence and contribution. My dream is to be a role model to my 
        siblings and others who may feel limited by their backgrounds. I want them to look at me and say: “If she could do it, so can I.”
    </p>



    <!-- Section 6: Closing Reflection -->
    <h2>My Journey Forward</h2>
